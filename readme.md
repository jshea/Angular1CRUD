This is a sample AngularJS version 1.x client application supporting both a Java middle tier/RDBMS backend as well as  Elasticsearch as the middle tier/data base.  These architectures are incorporated because
* [Firebase](http://firebase.com) is a commercial service that makes application and NoSQL hosting trivial and has a generous free plan.
* [Elasticsearch](http://elastic.co) makes a great development platform as it's the easiest to download, install, configure and run. This allows the repo to concentrate on sharing AngularJS knowledge and be the basis for business/CRUD applications.
* Java middle tier with a RDBMS backend happens to be the architecture of my day job.

Platform specific notes and artifacts are contained in the doc folder.

This example application demonstrates CRUD (Create, Report, Update and Delete) operations on a simple data model of a person (name, address, phone numbers...). It's a SPA (Single Page Application) built with the AngularJS  1.x framework and Bootstrap 3.x. AngularJS is the Single Page Application framework and Bootstrap provides UI formatting and components.

This is setup as a [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) project. While any IDE or text editor can be used to work with the source of this application, it's setup with the Netbeans default folder structure.

## Overview
The doc folder contains documentation on the overall application, tools and technologies used, installation and configuration instructions as well as information on additional backend technologies that can be used.

### Technology and Tools
#### AngularJS
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) is a web application framework for building what's commonly called SPA's ([Single Page Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)). It is an Open Source project managed by the [Mountain View Chocolate Factory](http://google.com) .
#### Bootstrap
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is a web development framework for making applications responsive and enhancing UI functionality.
#### NetBeans
[NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) is an Open Source IDE that has good Java and SPA support. The latest versions has built in support for AngularJS, Cordova and many other Web application development technologies, frameworks and libraries.
#### Visual Studio Code
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an Open Source editor that is picking up mindshare in the AngularJS (and many other) community.

## Folders and files in the application
The following is a quick tour of the folders and files that comprise the application. Not every folder and file
is listed here, just the highlights.

File|Description
----|------------
.gitignore | Files and folders to exclude from git. This includes build and dist folders used in building the application, bower_components which is a cached folder contains downloaded JavaScript libraries and various node_module folders containing tools dependencies.
build.xml | The ant build file for Netbeans.
readme.md | This is the file you're reading!
todo.md | Things I need to get around to.
\doc | Documentation for this application. Subfolders contain scripts for creating the RDBMS objects, loading data and other misc documentation.
\lib | Libraries for the Java\Jersey REST web service middle tier for access to a RDBMS data store. Not used when using Elasticsearch.
\nbproject | Netbeans settings files, not normally edited by a developer.
\src  | Java source code for the Java\Jersey REST web service middle tier for access to a RDBMS data store. Not used when using Elasticsearch.
\test | Test infrastructure for the Java\Jersey middle tier, application front end and end-to-end application testing.
\web | The client portion of the application. This is the AngularJS/Bootstrap SPA.
