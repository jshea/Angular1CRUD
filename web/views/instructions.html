<h3>Instructions</h3>

<h4>Building and Running the Java/RDBMS version of AngularCRUD</h4>

<h5>Overview</h5>
The doc folder contains documentation on the overall application, tools and technologies used, installation and
configuration instructions as well as information on additional backend technologies that can be used.

<h5>Installation</h5>

<h6>Middle Tier</h6>
Update PersonDAO.java with the unique id for your application. This will facilitate multiple people working with this
application in the same database instance.


Update DBConnection.getConnection() with your database connection information:
<h6>Backend</h6>
Update doc\PersonDDL.sql with the unique id for your application. This will allow separate tables for each user working
in a common database instance.
<pre>
   conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@server:port:sid", "uid", "pw");
</pre>


<h5>Building and Deployment</h5>
Building the application is a combination of Gulp and compiling the tiers as a Java WAR file.

<h6>Gulp</h6>
To build the application, just run `gulp` from the project's gulp folder.
<pre>
W:\Development\Projects\AngularCRUD\gulp> gulp
[13:48:47] Using gulpfile W:\Development\Projects\AngularCRUD\gulp\gulpfile.js
[13:48:47] Starting 'debug-app-js-java'...
[13:48:47] Starting 'debug-libs-js'...
[13:48:47] Starting 'debug-css'...
[13:48:47] Finished 'debug-css' after 368 ms
[13:48:47] Finished 'debug-app-js-java' after 403 ms
[13:48:47] Finished 'debug-libs-js' after 833 ms
[13:48:47] Starting 'default'...
[13:48:47] Finished 'default' after 21 Âµs
W:\Development\Projects\AngularCRUD\gulp>
</pre>
This gulp task concatenates:
<ul>
   <li> JavaScript files we created into AngularCRUDApp.debug.js
   <li> Third party libraries into AngularCRUDLibs.debug.js
   <li> CSS files into AngularCRUD.debug.css
</ul>

These three files are placed in the folder `AngularCRUD\web\dist`.

<h6>Compiling the WAR</h6>
To compile a Java Web Archive (WAR file) that can be deployed to a Java Application Server (JBOSS, WebLogic, GlassFish...)
we use the Netbeans IDE.

After running gulp to prepare the two js and one css file,
<ul>
   <li> Run/Clean and Build Project from the menu
   <li> or  shift-F11 from the keyboard
   <li> or hammer and broom icon on the toolbar
</ul>
